A professional, production-grade **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** engineered for the CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship. This platform functions as a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard, orchestrating Suricata for deep packet inspection, a high-throughput async Python backend, and a real-time React frontend.

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The modern threat landscape requires network defenses that are not just accurate, but highly observable. Traditional NIDS setups often relegate analysts to archaic terminal interfaces or slow-polling dashboards. 

This project bridges that gap by providing a **real-time, asynchronous pipeline** that ingests raw network packets, parses Suricata EVE logs instantaneously, enriches the data via Threat Intelligence APIs, and pushes the alerts directly to a high-performance Next.js dashboard via WebSockets.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This repository strictly adheres to a **Layered Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and testability.

### 1. Detection Engine (Suricata)
Running in a privileged Docker container bound to the host network interface, Suricata acts as the frontline packet sniffer. It utilizes a combination of Emerging Threats (ET) rules and custom `.rules` files to detect anomalies ranging from nmap scans to SQL injections. Output is aggressively batched to `eve.json`.

### 2. The Asynchronous Backend (FastAPI)
The core of the system is a Python 3.11 API. To prevent Database Connection Pool exhaustion during a SYN Flood attack, the backend employs:
- **`aiofiles` & `asyncio.Queue`**: An async worker tails the `eve.json` log, pushing raw JSON into memory queues rather than blocking I/O.
- **SQLAlchemy (Async)**: Background workers batch-insert records into SQLite (or PostgreSQL).
- **FastAPI WebSockets**: A broadcast manager pushes the validated `Alert` schemas to connected clients with sub-10ms latency.

### 3. The Frontend App (Next.js 14)
Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Zustand. Real-time SOC dashboards are notoriously difficult to build due to React re-render cycles crashing the browser under heavy alert loads. We solved this by:
- **Zustand State Stores**: Removing prop-drilling entirely.
- **Debounced WebSockets**: Incoming frames are buffered into a 100ms window, triggering exactly one React re-render per window regardless of alert volume.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Node.js 20+ (for local UI compilation)

### One-Command Setup
We provide an automated bootstrap script that checks dependencies, builds the containers, generates environment files, and runs database migrations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harisx404/CodeAlpha-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
cd CodeAlpha-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System

# Run the unified setup script
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The SOC Dashboard will be immediately available at `http://localhost:3000`. The API Swagger documentation is at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

---

## 🛡️ Penetration Testing & Simulation

To prove the system works, we included a penetration testing script that utilizes `scapy` to simulate a live attack against the local network interface.

```bash
# Generate 60 seconds of realistic attack traffic (Requires root/admin privileges)
sudo python scripts/generate_traffic.py --duration 60 --interface eth0
```
*This will immediately trigger Suricata alerts, which will cascade through the async backend and flash red on your Next.js dashboard.*
