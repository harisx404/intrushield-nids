A professional, production-grade **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** engineered for the CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship. This platform functions as a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard, orchestrating Suricata for deep packet inspection, a high-throughput async Python backend, and a real-time React frontend.

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The modern threat landscape requires network defenses that are not just accurate, but highly observable. Traditional NIDS setups often relegate analysts to archaic terminal interfaces or slow-polling dashboards. 

This project bridges that gap by providing a **real-time, asynchronous pipeline** that ingests raw network packets, parses Suricata EVE logs instantaneously, enriches the data via Threat Intelligence APIs, and pushes the alerts directly to a high-performance Next.js dashboard via WebSockets.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This repository strictly adheres to a **Layered Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and testability.

### 1. Detection Engine (Suricata)
Running in a privileged Docker container bound to the host network interface, Suricata acts as the frontline packet sniffer. It utilizes a combination of Emerging Threats (ET) rules and custom `.rules` files to detect anomalies ranging from nmap scans to SQL injections. Detections are written as line-delimited JSON to `eve.json`.

### 2. The Asynchronous Backend (FastAPI)
The core of the system is a Python 3.11 API built around non-blocking I/O so ingestion doesn't stall request handling. The backend employs:
- **`aiofiles` Tailing**: A background async task tails `eve.json` non-blockingly, parsing new lines as they're written rather than blocking the event loop on I/O.
- **SQLAlchemy (Async)**: Alerts are persisted through an async session to SQLite (or PostgreSQL).
- **FastAPI WebSockets**: A broadcast manager pushes validated `Alert` payloads to every connected client as soon as they are ingested.

### 3. The Frontend App (Next.js 14)
Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Zustand. Key choices:
- **Zustand State Stores**: Alerts land in a shared store, keeping prop-drilling out of the component tree.
- **Auto-reconnecting WebSocket**: A `useWebSocket` hook maintains the live feed with exponential backoff (1s up to 32s) and dispatches incoming alerts straight into the store.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Node.js 20+ (for local UI compilation)

### One-Command Setup
We provide an automated bootstrap script that checks dependencies, builds the containers, generates environment files, and runs database migrations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harisx404/CodeAlpha-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
cd CodeAlpha-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System

# Run the unified setup script
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The SOC Dashboard will be immediately available at `http://localhost:3000`. The API Swagger documentation is at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

---

## 🛡️ Penetration Testing & Simulation

To exercise the pipeline end to end, we include a traffic-generation script that uses `scapy` to craft attack-like packets against the local interface. `scapy` ships in the dev requirements:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt

# Generate 60 seconds of attack-like traffic (requires root/admin privileges)
sudo python scripts/generate_traffic.py --duration 60 --interface eth0
```
*This will immediately trigger Suricata alerts, which will cascade through the async backend and flash red on your Next.js dashboard.*

## 🤝 Contributing

CI runs on every pull request. The blocking checks are:
1. `ruff` — Python linting.
2. `black --check` — Python formatting.
3. `tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript type checking.
4. `pytest` — backend test suite.

`mypy` and `eslint` also run but are currently non-blocking.
